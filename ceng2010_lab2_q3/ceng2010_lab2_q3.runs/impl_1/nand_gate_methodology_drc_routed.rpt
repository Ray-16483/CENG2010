2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
